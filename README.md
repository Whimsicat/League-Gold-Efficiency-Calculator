**This project is awaiting the release of the updated Data Dragon (JSON) from Riot Games before continued development. 
**The updated JSON will come with new items/removal of old items & mythic items, which will fundamentally change how this project is coded.

Description: 
League Gold Effiency Calculator - Personal Project
C# / Visual Studio 2022 / JSON - 
Third party Program registered with Riot Games Developer Products.
Utilizies Riot Games' Data Dragon JSON File for all League of Legends in-game items, champions, runes, and icon assets for those three.
Works with Data Dragon 14.0+, might require manual updating outside of JSON depending on in game changes for League of Legends. 
(**I will have to learn more if its okay to setup scripts to auto update Data Dragon or if that's against a policy of Riot Games)
The program allows user to filter specific stas for most gold efficient in selected categories.
Additional option of modifying a champion of choice's level and ability levels to see the specific scaling and stats applied with or without specific items. 
(**This might be scrapped as I've heard Data Dragon isn't fully kept up with/accurate to live game numbers, so would provide the end-user misinformation)
Lastly, the program allows the user to fine tune specific items for niche cases.
(Some items have variables stats such as Mejai's Soulstealer which gives stats depending on amount of in-game kills without dying)
